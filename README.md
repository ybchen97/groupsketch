### Gameplay
Two phases of the game:
- Observation
- Drawing

During observation phase, game outputs a random pattern of colours based on the number of colours the players choose on the game settings page. Players then have a few seconds to memorise the pattern, before the screen disappears. Then, during the drawing phase, players have to recreate the pattern based off of memory.
